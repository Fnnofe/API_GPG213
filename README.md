Behavior Trees:



## Step1:# Create a new script make it inherent from TreeRoot this will be the tree.

## Step2:# Create a new script make it inherent from TreeNode this will be the behavior we want to implement
## Step3:#inside Evaluate() write the logic and return false to exit the node, true to stay in it
## Step4:# Use a constructor to assign unity  values to the script.
## Step5: #from the new tree script we made (Step1) inside the SetupTree() we return a new TreeNode equal to hirechoy of nodes we want to be processed like the image #below. The chart below is the equivalent version of the code here.
